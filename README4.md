# Problems

## Area: Search Engines

- Problem: Search engines cluttered with spam
- Problem: Search engine marketshare held by singular entity
- Solution: Tools like [Duck Duck Go][duck-duck-go], [Brave Search][brave-search], [Kagi][kagi], [You.com][you] help, but the SEO game remains
- Solution: Shared world knowledge base for product recommendations, alternatives, facts, blogs, tutorials, schemas discovert etc. (crowdsourcing)
- Solution: Custom search for site:reddit.com, site:news.hackernews.com

## Area: Robust Schema Navigation and Modification

- Problem: Given a schema of a mental model, cannot navigate, partition, edit, change view of schemas / subschemas / submodels
- Problem: Given a topic known to be general, how to note that when focusing on specialization

## Area: Experiments

- Problem: Difficult to setup code experiments with existing tools across ecosystems
- Solution: Tools like [CodePen][code-pen], [Godbolt][godbolt], [Rust Playground][rust-playground] help, but fragmentation remains

## Area: Identification of things across knowledge bases

- Solution: Identifiers like ISBN, URL schemas, and reverse DNS help, but fragmentation remains
- Or some URI system

## Area: New Tools

- Problem: High bar for creating new tools
- Solution: Metaframeworks like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) help, but does not cover specialization, integration with existing tools
- Research to application
- Solution: OOTB solution for mkdocs, VuePress, Pelican, etc., generalized SSG integration

## Area: Learning

- Solution: Jump-start learning new topics by using published schemas (and building a map relative to that)

## Area: Common Representations

- Problem: No common way to dynamically represent numerical values (ex. blog post mentioning 12ft, but no conversion available)
- Problem: Common representation of standards (in card/block form)
- Solution: `@username` and `#channel`, `#tag` are good, think about unifying and making new common ones

## Area: Dynamic FS

- Problem: Difficult to navigate FS
- Solution: Tab-based FS, but not popular or widely-implemented or used
- Solution: Dynamic hierarchy on file system depending on model schema, other factors

## Area: UI

- Improve context menus
- Confusing UI (big context menus, inflexiable panes, etc., no workspaces, etc.)
